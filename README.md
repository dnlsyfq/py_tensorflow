# TensorFlow

Interface for expressing machine learning algorithms 

### Concept
* Build
* Compile
* Train
* Evaluate

### Environment
* Direct
* Virtual
* Docker 

### Gradient Descent
* Populat optimizer for adjusting values to reduce error 
* finding steepest down the hill , fastest reduction 
* when reaches minimum , the loss value no longer decreases
* if learning rate set too high , it ends up bouncing around 
* calculating the derivatives of the model with respect to its features 
* gradient descent based optimizers are an often used method for minimizing loss
